### Setup

To begin, fork and clone this repository. Once it has finished downloading `cd` into the project root and run `npm i` to fetch the project dependencies. After they are fetched run `npm start` and a browser window will open at `http://localhost:3000` displaying a (non-functioning) chat app. In another terminal window run `npm test` to run the test suite.

### The plan

Today we'll be building a Twitter-esque chat application where you will be able to chat with other DevMountain students. This app will have real, persistent data via communication with a remote server. We'll be building the front end client using React, Redux, and Redux Promise Middleware.


### Step 1

**Summary**

In this step we'll be installing some new dependencies, creating the bones of our Redux setup, and connecting the application to Redux.

**Detailed Instructions**

Start out by installing the following dependencies:

* `redux`
* `react-redux`
* [`axios`](https://github.com/mzabriskie/axios) - The library we'll be using to make HTTP requests for data
* [`redux-promise-middleware`](https://github.com/pburtchaell/redux-promise-middleware) - A tool that allows us to handle async actions much easier!

While those download, go ahead and open up `src/ducks/post.js` to set up our reducer. Create an `initialState` variable with one property: `posts` set equal to an empty array. Create and export by default a function `post` which takes the regular two reducer parameters: `state = initialState` and `action`. The reducer should `switch` over `action.type`, returning `state` as the `default` case.

Next up, open `src/store.js` and import the following:

* `applyMiddleware` and `createStore` from Redux
* `promiseMiddleware` from Redux Promise Middleware
* `post` from `src/ducks/post.js`

Now we need to create and export by default a store configured to use the Promise middleware. Invoke `createStore` passing in three arguments:

* `post` - As usual we need our reducer.
* `undefined` - Here we could give Redux an initial state, but since we are handling that in our reducer we need to let Redux know that we don't have an initial state here.
* `applyMiddleware( promiseMiddleware() )` - `applyMiddleware` configures our store to run each action through the middleware before passing it along to our reducer.

That's all it takes to configure the store to use the new middleware! Go ahead and open `src/index.js` and take the standard steps to connect the application to Redux. Import `Provider` from React Redux and `store` from `src/store.js`. Wrap the `App` component in `Provider`, passing `store` as a prop.

Now open up `src/App.js` and import `connect` from React Redux. Underneath the component definition replace the current default export with `export default connect( state => state )( App );`. You'll notice we performed our `mapStateToProps` function inline, instead of breaking it out. This is because our `App` component needs the whole of state, and it is simpler to perform a quick, inline, anonymous function. Either way works though!

That's it for this step! You should now be able to `console.log` `this.props` in the `render` method and see the application state.

export default connect( state => state )( App );
```

### Step 2

**Summary**

In this step we'll be setting up the API request to fetch posts and updating our reducer to be able to handle the asynchronous actions.

**Detailed Instructions**

Start out in `src/ducks/post.js`. We'll first create some constants to help us avoid errors from typos. At the top of the file create the following variables:

* `const PENDING = "_PENDING"`
* `const FULFILLED = "_FULFILLED"`
* `const REJECTED = "_REJECTED"`

These are the suffixes that the promise middleware will apply to our asynchronous actions, we want to save them to variables for two reasons: ease of use, and avoiding errors!

Next, create an action type of `SET_POSTS` set equal to `"SET_POSTS"`. Underneath the reducer create and export an action creator function `setPosts` which takes a single parameter `postsPromise`. This action creator should return an object that looks like this `{ payload: postsPromise, type: SET_POSTS }`.

Now that we have an action creator ready to go, we need to update our state and reducer to be able to handle that action. Add two new properties to `initialState`:

* `loadingPosts` - Set equal to `false`
* `errorFetchingPosts` - Set equal to `false`

Lastly for this file, we need to update the reducer. Add a new `case` checking `action.type` against `SET_POSTS + PENDING`. In this case, return a new object that looks like this:

```javascript
Object.assign( {}, state, {
	  errorFetchingPosts: false // Because we haven't yet heard back from the server, we can't have an error!
	, loadingPosts: true
} );
```

In the `case` of `SET_POSTS + FULFILLED` we want to return this:

```javascript
Object.assign( {}, state, {
	  errorFetchingPosts: false // Fulfilled only fires on success
	, loadingPosts: false // We've finished loading now
	, posts: action.payload // Once the request returns, our middleware will place the data on action.payload for us.
} );
```

You may wonder why we are using `Object.assign` in the above, since we are completely replacing state. Good question! We're just future proofing against changes we'll need to make later.

The last `case` will be `SET_POSTS + REJECTED` and should return this:

```javascript
Object.assign( {}, state, {
	  errorFetchingPosts: true // Rejected means we've had an error, we'll need to let the user know in the component.
	, loadingPosts: false
} );
```

That's all for this file, go ahead and open up `src/services/postService.js` and import the following:

* `axios` from Axios
* `store` from `src/store.js`
* `setPosts` from `src/ducks/post.js`

Create a new variable named `BASE_URL` and set it equal to `"practiceapi.devmountain.com/devchat-api/api/"`.

Next we'll need to create and export a function `getPosts` which takes no parameters. Inside the function create a variable `postsPromise` set equal to:

```javascript
axios.get( BASE_URL + "posts" )
	.then( response => {
		console.log( response );
		return response.data;
	} );
```

Then call `store.dispatch( setPosts( postsPromise ) )`.

That's it for this step! Go ahead and call your service function and check out the data that is coming back.

**Note:** Because the server is (hopefully!) working well, it may difficult to test out what happens during pending requests or rejections. For this reason the API is designed to allow you to fake these things!

* To delay how long a request takes, add a `delay` parameter to the request URL. For example: `axios.get( BASE_URL + "posts?delay=2000" )` would tell the server to wait 2000ms (2 seconds) before responding to the request.
* To get an error, simply add an `error=true` query. For example: `axios.get( BASE_URL + "posts?error=true" )`.
* These can be combined like so: `axios.get( BASE_URL + "posts?error=true&delay=1500" )`

	const postsPromise = axios.get( BASE_URL + "posts" ).then( response => response.data );

	store.dispatch( setPosts( postsPromise ) );
}
```

### Step 3

**Summary**

In this step we will be displaying posts, allowing the user to refresh the list of posts, and displaying a loading indicator while posts load.
