### Setup

To begin, fork and clone this repository. Once it has finished downloading `cd` into the project root and run `npm i` to fetch the project dependencies. After they are fetched run `npm start` and a browser window will open at `http://localhost:3000` displaying a (non-functioning) chat app. In another terminal window run `npm test` to run the test suite.

### The plan

Today we'll be building a Twitter-esque chat application where you will be able to chat with other DevMountain students. This app will have real, persistent data via communication with a remote server. We'll be building the front end client using React, Redux, and Redux Promise Middleware.


### Step 1

**Summary**

In this step we'll be installing some new dependencies, creating the bones of our Redux setup, and connecting the application to Redux.

**Detailed Instructions**

Start out by installing the following dependencies:

* `redux`
* `react-redux`
* `axios` - The library we'll be using to make HTTP requests for data
* `redux-promise-middleware` - A tool that allows us to handle async actions much easier!

While those download, go ahead and open up `src/ducks/post.js` to set up our reducer. Create an `initialState` variable with one property: `posts` set equal to an empty array. Create and export by default a function `post` which takes the regular two reducer parameters: `state = initialState` and `action`.

Next up, open `src/store.js` and import the following:

* `applyMiddleware` and `createStore` from Redux
* `promiseMiddleware` from Redux PromiseMiddleware
* `post` from `src/ducks/post.js`
